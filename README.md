# Indego-shared-bike-project
## Introduction
Philadelphia introduced Indego as the city's newest mode of public transit in 2015. The Office of Transportation and Infrastructure Systems (OTIS) is in charge of planning and managing it. It has provided us with a great deal of convenience over the last few years. However, the initiative is still in its infancy, and there is opportunity for development. During peak hours, for example, users may find themselves without a bike to use or docks to return their bikes. We believe that a study of the usage pattern would be beneficial in helping to improve the service.

In this analysis, we are interested in how long a bike trip will take in general, as well as what factors influence the length of the trip. In our analysis, we have two key points of focus. First, we'll use features such as trip type (whether it's a one-way or round-trip), user type (if the user has a membership), trip start and end times, and weather data to estimate journey duration. Second, we'll utilize time series analysis to predict journey duration in May 2022 based on the average time spent traveling on each day. Indego could utilize the information to improve their service and management if a pattern emerges.
